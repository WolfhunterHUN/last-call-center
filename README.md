Last Call Center 🎮
An AI-powered apocalypse customer service game

🏆 Global Supercell AI Game Hackathon
Feb 6–8, 2026

--------------------------------------------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW

Last Call Center is a first-person, narrative-driven, AI-assisted game created during the
Global Supercell AI Game Hackathon. The project was developed in an intense multi-day sprint
with a strong focus on atmosphere, storytelling, and AI-driven interactions.

You are not here to save the world.
You are here to keep it operational for five more minutes.

--------------------------------------------------
STORY

The apocalypse didn’t come in one form.
It came in all of them.

Yesterday morning started with a routine system check. At 08:42 GMT, seismic alerts triggered
across three continents. Asteroids, volcanoes, power failures, biological threats, and even
reality itself began to unravel.

By noon, the world had agreed on one thing:
This was it.

And yet, somehow, the internet was still partially online.

--------------------------------------------------
THE COMPANY

You work for OmniSure Solutions™ — a fully outsourced, fully automated, fully insured customer
service provider. OmniSure doesn’t sell products. It sells responses.

When companies don’t want to deal with angry customers, legal gray areas, emotional breakdowns,
or ethically questionable edge cases, everything is forwarded to OmniSure.

When the apocalypse started, most coworkers evacuated.

But the calls didn’t stop.
They rerouted.

--------------------------------------------------
YOUR ROLE

You were supposed to be off yesterday. Your contract technically ended six months ago, but the
system never processed it.

Now, as reality collapses outside your office window, customers are calling about:

- Refunds under “force majeure”
- Warranties that don’t mention planetary destruction
- Auto-renewed subscriptions during the end of civilization
- Service-level agreements they believe the apocalypse violates

The phones keep ringing.
The chat queues keep filling.
Your headset still works.

Welcome back to work.

--------------------------------------------------
GAMEPLAY

Last Call Center is a first-person customer service simulator where you:

- Handle AI-driven apocalyptic support tickets
- Manage rising stress levels during your shift
- Interact with the office environment
- Use stress-relief items to stay functional
- Try to survive the shift without breaking down completely

Player decisions directly influence stress, pacing, and outcome.
